Here’s a best-practice setup for managing dev vs prod requirements with pip-tools:

✅ Step 1: Project Structure
project/
│
├── requirements.in          # Base (common) dependencies
├── requirements-dev.in      # Dev-only dependencies
├── requirements.txt         # Pinned prod dependencies (generated)
├── requirements-dev.txt     # Pinned dev dependencies (generated)
└── src/                     # Your application code

✅ How It Works

requirements.in → Your main app dependencies (e.g., Django, requests).
requirements-dev.in → Includes dev tools (e.g., pytest, black) and references requirements.in:
Plain Text-r requirements.inpytestblackShow more lines

    -r requirements.in
    pytest
    black

requirements.txt → Generated from requirements.in (prod environment).
requirements-dev.txt → Generated from requirements-dev.in (dev environment).

✅ Step 2: Create Your Input Files

Generate prod requirements:
       requirements.in 
            Django
            requests 

Generate dev requirements:
        requirements-dev.in 
            -r requirements.in
            pytest
            black

✅ Step 3: Compile Pinned Requirements
    pip-compile requirements.in
    pip-compile requirements.dev.in

Install prod and dev:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

    This creates:
requirements.txt → pinned versions for prod
requirements-dev.txt → pinned versions for dev (includes prod + dev tools)

✅ Step 4: Install and Sync

    pip-sync requirements.txt
    pip-sync requirements-dev.txt

What happens?
    Installs everything in the file.
    Removes anything NOT listed (keeps environment clean).

✅ Step 5: Upgrade All Packages
When you want the latest compatible versions:

    pip-compile --upgrade requirements.in
    pip-compile --upgrade requirements-dev.in
    pip-sync requirements-dev.txt   # or requirements.txt for prod



## creating a .makefile and running This
.makefile
compile:
    pip-compile requirements.in

sync:
    pip-sync requirements.txt

upgrade:
    pip-compile --upgrade requirements.in
    pip-sync requirements.txt


Runt this as:
make compile    # Generate requirements.txt
make sync       # Sync environment


****<< when a new Packages has to be added ... do following

echo "gensim" >> requirements.in   # or edit manually
pip-compile requirements.in        # regenerate requirements.txt
pip-sync requirements.txt          # sync environment
