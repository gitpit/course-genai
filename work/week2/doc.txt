# Coffee Production

Coffee is one of the world's most traded commodities, second only to oil. The process begins with coffee cherries grown primarily in the "Bean Belt" near the equator. Two main coffee species dominate the market: Arabica and Robusta. Farmers harvest the cherries when ripe, then process them through either dry or wet methods to extract the beans. After processing, the green coffee beans are sorted, graded, and shipped to roasters worldwide. Different growing regions produce distinct flavor profiles, from the bright acidity of Ethiopian beans to the full-bodied richness of Indonesian varieties.

# Space Exploration

Humans began their journey to the stars with the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, marking the beginning of the Space Age. Since then, space exploration has achieved remarkable milestones including the Moon landings, Mars rovers, and the International Space Station. Modern space exploration involves both government agencies and private companies, with missions ranging from satellite deployment to planetary exploration. Technologies developed for space missions have led to numerous everyday innovations, from memory foam to satellite navigation systems that we now take for granted.

# The Human Brain

The human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons and weighs about 3 pounds. This remarkable organ controls everything from basic bodily functions to complex cognitive tasks like abstract thinking and creative expression. It consumes about 20% of the body's energy despite making up only 2% of total body weight. The brain processes information through a vast network of neural connections, with different regions specializing in various functions such as memory, emotion, vision, and motor control. Recent research continues to reveal new insights about brain plasticity and its ability to adapt throughout life.
